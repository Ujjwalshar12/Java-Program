JAVA 

we can compile the program file without adding the main method , but we can't execute it 
and if making changes in the file again compile it 

there are two types or orientation in java 
block and line 

1.Printing statement
for printing anything or output in java 
3 values 
--print
syntax- System.out.print("");
--println
syntax- System.out.println("");

-both are line oriented so close with semi colon 
-difference - println will also create a new line after printing but print doesn't.
-System S should be capital.

--printf - but not used 

some data can be printed without quotes they are number(+ - whole decimal) and Boolean
-if print statement is empty compilation error but println will make a new line


Characters can be printed inside single as well as double quotes but there should only be one character only.

Inside Double quotes will can print anything 

Variables 
-container to store the value(primitive and non-primitive) 
-for making variables in java will go with the conponent of datatype (primitive and non-primitive)

Typecasting in java is of two types 
1-primitive 
-implicit or widening
-explicit or narrowing

2-non primitive 
-upcasting
-downcasting

Convention for classname - first alphabhet capital for each word in a class name 
Convention for variable= if single word then all letters in small 
if multiple words should be in small letters and separated by underscore

scope defined variables 

byte+byte=int****
short+short=int****

--return type of relational operator is Boolean (they are used for conditions)


--Number is less than 20 
--number is in between 20 and 50
--check the character is uppercase character 
--check the character is lowercase or not 
--check the character is vowel 
--check the character is lowercase vowel
--check the character is uppercase vowel
--check the character is consonant of not.
